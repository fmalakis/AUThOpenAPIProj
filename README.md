# AUThOpenAPIProj

This project is being developed for the purposes of the School of Code assignment (NCO-05-05, Software Engineering), from the Software Engineering class of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Computer Science Department. It is an attempt at creating an interactive catalog/finder of all the classes offered at AUTh, organised by their respective Faculties and Departments, using the AUTh Open Data API. This app was developed using Angular, Bootstrap and Angular Material for theming.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.0.4.

## How to run

Run `npm i` in the project's root folder to install all dependencies.

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
